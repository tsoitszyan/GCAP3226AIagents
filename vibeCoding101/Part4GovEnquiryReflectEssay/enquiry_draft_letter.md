Subject: Request for Data on Overlapping Bus Services and Planning Criteria

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Tsoi Tszyan, a student at Hong Kong Baptist University enrolled in the GCAP 3226 course. I am conducting research on bus route coordination and service optimization in Hong Kong, focusing on overlapping services between Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) and Citybus, and I have compiled arrival times for overlapping stops.

I would like to request the following data:
- List of bus stops and routes where KMB and Citybus services overlap
- Criteria and guidelines used for planning and approving overlapping routes
- Historical changes in overlapping services (if available)
- Preferred format: CSV or Excel
- Time period: Most recent available, plus any historical data from the past five years

The data will be used for academic research and policy analysis to better understand public transport coordination and inform recommendations for service improvement. Reference is made to the Code on Access to Information. I have reviewed available open data on data.gov.hk but found the above information is not fully covered.

Please contact me at 23229101@life.hkbu.edu.hk. I would appreciate a response within two weeks.

Thank you for your attention.

Yours Faithfully,
Tsoi Tszyan
Hong Kong Baptist University
