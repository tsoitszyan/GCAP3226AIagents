Subject: Data Enquiry – Overlapping Bus Stops and Planning Criteria (KMB & Citybus)

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Tsoi Tszyan, a student from HKBU (GCAP 3226). I am conducting research on bus route coordination and have identified several bus stops where both KMB and Citybus provide services, such as 銅鑼灣 (Causeway Bay), 灣仔 (Wan Chai), 尖沙咀 (Tsim Sha Tsui). Using open data, I have compiled arrival times for these overlapping stops, but would like to request:
- A comprehensive and official list of all bus stops/routes served by both KMB and Citybus
- The planning criteria and guidelines for approving overlapping routes and stops
- Any historical changes or policy documents regarding overlapping services in the past five years
- Preferred format: CSV/Excel

This data will support academic research and policy analysis. While open data provides some information, more detailed and official data is needed for a thorough analysis. Reference: data.gov.hk

Please reply to 23229101@life.hkbu.edu.hk if possible. Thank you very much for your assistance.

Best regards,
Tsoi Tsz Yan
