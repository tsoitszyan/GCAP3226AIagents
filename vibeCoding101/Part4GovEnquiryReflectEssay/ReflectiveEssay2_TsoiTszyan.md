## Introduction
In this assignment, I investigated the process of accessing government data in Hong Kong, focusing on drafting formal enquiries and evaluating open data practices. This experience provided valuable insights into data transparency and communication with public authorities. 

## Main Body
I learned that while some government data, such as bus arrival times, is openly accessible, more detailed information about overlapping bus stops and planning criteria requires a formal request. Drafting the enquiry email was challenging, as I needed to specify the exact data required. The AI agent helped me organize my request and identify missing data, saving me time on data compilation. Through this process, I developed skills in formal writing, data analysis, and strategic communication. Access to comprehensive government data will strengthen my project, but if requests are denied, I can use open datasets or conduct field observations. 

## Conclusion
This experience enhanced my understanding of data-driven policymaking and the importance of clear, professional communication. I plan to apply these skills in future research and public engagement projects.
