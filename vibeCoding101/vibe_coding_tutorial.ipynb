    "### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't forget to push to GitHub** - Local files won't be graded!  \n",
    "❌ **Don't keep repo private** - Grading scripts can't access it!  \n",
    "❌ **Don't submit wrong links** - Test them first!  \n",
    "❌ **Don't miss the deadline** - 17 Oct 11pm is firm!  \n",
    "❌ **Don't skip the Moodle forum post** - GitHub alone isn't enough!  \n",

    "## Part 2: Accessing Hong Kong Government Open Data via API\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we explore how to access Hong Kong's government open data programmatically using APIs. We'll use the **MTR (Mass Transit Railway) Next Train API** as a practical example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Location**: `Part2APIaccessGovOpenData/`\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Built\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI agent has created a complete API access tutorial with the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **README.md** - Comprehensive documentation including:\n",
    "   - API endpoints and parameters\n",
    "   - MTR line and station codes\n",
    "   - Response format explanations\n",
    "   - Code examples in multiple languages\n",
    "   - Use cases and best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **mtr_api_test.py** - Python test script that:\n",
    "   - Connects to the MTR Next Train API\n",
    "   - Retrieves real-time train arrival data\n",
    "   - Tests multiple stations across different MTR lines\n",
    "   - Generates formatted output and reports\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **mtr_api_output.json** - Sample API response data\n",
    "4. **mtr_api_report.txt** - Test summary report\n",
    "5. **requirements.txt** - Python dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔑 Key Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "**API Basics**:\n",
    "- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow programmatic access to data\n",
    "- RESTful APIs use HTTP requests with parameters\n",
    "- Responses are typically in JSON format\n",
    "\n",
    "**MTR Next Train API**:\n",
    "- Endpoint: `https://rt.data.gov.hk/v1/transport/mtr/getSchedule.php`\n",
    "- Parameters: `line` (MTR line code), `sta` (station code), `lang` (language)\n",
    "- Returns real-time train arrival information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Available**:\n",
    "- Train destination and platform\n",
    "- Estimated arrival time\n",
    "- Minutes until arrival\n",
    "- Service delay indicators\n",
    "- Separate data for UP and DOWN directions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 How to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the test script:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd Part2APIaccessGovOpenData\n",
    "python3 mtr_api_test.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The script will:\n",
    "1. Query multiple MTR stations\n",
    "2. Display real-time train information\n",
    "3. Generate JSON output with full API responses\n",
    "4. Create a summary report\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Example Output\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Querying: Tuen Ma Line - Tuen Mun\n",
    "✓ Success! Found 4 upcoming trains\n",
    "\n",
    "TML-TUM:\n",
    "  DOWN direction:\n",
    "    Train to WKS: 5 min (Platform 2)\n",
    "    Train to WKS: 11 min (Platform 1)\n",
    "    Train to WKS: 17 min (Platform 2)\n",
    "    Train to WKS: 23 min (Platform 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of API access can be used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transit Apps** - Build apps showing real-time train arrivals\n",
    "2. **Data Analysis** - Analyze service patterns and frequency\n",
    "3. **Research Projects** - Study public transportation usage\n",
    "4. **Policy Analysis** - Evaluate transit accessibility\n",
    "5. **Dashboards** - Create live information displays\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Extension Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "You could extend this project by:\n",
    "- Visualizing train arrival patterns over time\n",
    "- Creating a web dashboard with live updates\n",
    "- Analyzing peak vs off-peak service frequency\n",
    "- Comparing different MTR lines\n",
    "- Building a mobile app interface\n",
    "- Setting up alerts for service delays\n",
    "\n",
